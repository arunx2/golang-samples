Inside the package is a bomb set to go off at midnight by a couple of unseen thugs. Who they are and why they want to blow up someone else is never know. What this cartoon focuses on is Donald's conflict with a black cat who has crossed his path.\n\nYes, you can pretty much figure out that Donald is going to lose his tempter and go mad, delaying delivery of the package and risk blowing himself to smithereens. But the color pallet of this short is dark and noir-ish and is a welcome difference from the usual sunny atmospheres Donald finds himself in. A better than average Donald Duck cartoon.", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "7"}}, "duration": "PT8M"}
