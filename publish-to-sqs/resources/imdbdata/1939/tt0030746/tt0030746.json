Obviously this film has been overshadowed by Viv's more famous films, but I awarded it 7/10 as it shows off her versatility.My only criticism was her difficulty in maintaining an authentic Cockney accent but of course drama schools in the 1930s drummed out regional vernacular accents from their students, long before the current trend of casting actors with authentic sounding voices.\n\nMy copy is on a \"Double Kino Video Feature\" along with Henry Fonda's \"Wings of the Morning\".Users who like this film should also seek out \"Storm in a Teacup\" who apart from Viv & Rex has Cecil Parker.", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "7"}}, "duration": "PT1H25M"}
