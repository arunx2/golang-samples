Nancy Drew...Reporter was the second of four films that starred Bonita Granville as the title character for Warner Bros. Directed at a fast pace with crackling dialogue and humorous and suspenseful moments throughout, this movie is a breeze at just 68 minutes. Wonderful supporting cast includes John Litel as Nancy's father, Frankie Thomas as Nancy's boyfriend Ted, and Mary Lee and Dickie Jones as Ted's sister and her friend who cause trouble wherever they go. The last two had a future association with Gene Autry with Lee appearing in some of his '40s movies and Dickie (later Dick) also appearing with him then starring in later TV series \"Range Rider\" and \"Buffalo Bill, Jr.\" for Autry's production company. Though it stops the story, there is a wonderful swinging version of Nursery Rhymes as sung by Granville, Thomas, Lee, and Jones. Dickie would also be famous as the title character voice of Walt Disney's Pinocchio. Well worth seeing for fans of Drew and '30s programmers. P.S. Joan Leslie and Florence Halop appear as classmates of Nancy in the newsroom field trip sequence.", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "7"}}, "duration": "PT1H8M"}
