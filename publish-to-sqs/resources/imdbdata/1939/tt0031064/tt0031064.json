But as soon as all the big stars in the studio find out Donald is in the midst they all hound him and he drowns in their own autographs books.\n\nA simple idea and a weak plot and it's got those freaky-looking caricatures of real people again but I did find this funnier than usual.", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "7"}}, "duration": "PT8M"}
