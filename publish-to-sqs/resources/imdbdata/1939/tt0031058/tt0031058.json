Hay is cast in his favourite role ; a seedily incompetent authority figure who conceals his uncertainty behind bluster and bombast.\n\nThis is one of those rare films where the plot is almost an intrusion ; who cares about a smuggling ring in rural England, when we can instead enjoy the antics of Hay and his cohorts, playing possibly the most inept police team in the history of law enforcement.  Their attempts to set a speed trap, and then to justify their results to an irate motorist, may be the high spot of the film."}, "duration": "PT1H23M"}
