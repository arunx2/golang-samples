I could have seen someone like James Cagney who in 1939 the same year that Buried Alive came out starred in Each Dawn I Die. Some of the elements of that classic are in Buried Alive.\n\nRobert Wilcox plays a model prisoner and trustee and is looking forward to his parole and maybe settling down with prison nurse Beverly Roberts. But George Pembroke who plays the executioner the guy sets up the electric chair is having angst and in the worst place, a bar. When Pembroke gets into a brawl with bottom feeding reporter Wheeler Oakman, Wilcox steps in and saves him.\n\nOakman has his revenge in the press and the story he prints kills Wilcox's parole. Later on while trying to stop a break by a mentally deranged prisoner another convict lies and Wilcox is on death row for the death of a guard.\n\nThere are some good elements in the story and if this had been done at a major studio with a bit more care it could have been a classic.\n\nAs it is it's a sloppy PRC product.", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "3"}}, "duration": "PT1H2M"}
