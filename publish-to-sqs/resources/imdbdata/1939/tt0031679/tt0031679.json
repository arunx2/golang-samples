The movie may be about Mr. Smith (Stewart), but much of it is seen through Saunder's (Arthur's) eyes.  When she falls in love with Smith, we can't help but do it too.\n\nThis is Capra's opus, and contains not one, but two of the best acting performances I've ever seen."}, "duration": "PT2H9M", "trailer": {"@type": "VideoObject", "name": "Mr. Smith Goes To Washington", "embedUrl": "/video/imdb/vi1789722905", "thumbnail": {"@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BODk2OWM4YmQtNmU1Ny00N2ZkLThjMzctYTI0Mzc1M2UyYTUyXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BODk2OWM4YmQtNmU1Ny00N2ZkLThjMzctYTI0Mzc1M2UyYTUyXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg", "description": "Home Video Trailer from Columbia Tristar", "uploadDate": "2008-04-11T14:26:47Z"}}
