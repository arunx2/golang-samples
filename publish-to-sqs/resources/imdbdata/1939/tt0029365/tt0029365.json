But it is a pleasant enough film showing the upper classes in the United Kingdom enjoying their privileges.\n\nDutiful Merle Oberon and Dr. Rex Harrison are attending Merle's grandfather until his demise. Grandpa never spent a dime and his only living heir inherits 18 million pounds. At the age she's at she will not hoard, but instead starts moving with the upper crust and gets a few upper crust admirers chiefly Robert Douglas son of the richest man in the United Kingdom.\n\nHarrison gets tired though and wants to get back to practicing medicine. But Merle's just starting to go through the fortune and all the admirers it's bringing.\n\nHarrison walks out but like Levi Johnson he's acquired some notoriety of his own and he gets an offer from some sanitarium that caters to the disgustingly rich to join their staff though he at first doesn't really know why. \n\nOf course in the end it all works out. Over in America had this been done by a Leo McCarey or a Mitchell Leisen Over The Moon might have been a comedy classic. It had the makings, but it falls short.", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "6"}}, "duration": "PT1H18M"}
