I praise also the terrific screenplay, which reminded me at times of a Shakespearean romantic comedy. The dialog is fitting for the characters, who are educated Americans of the mid 20th century, none of them destined for greatness, but for the lives of average Americans, which is what most Americans hope for. The script was adept at bringing out the emotions of the characters and the interactions of family life. It was especially apropos for the two divergent wanderers, one inexperienced and the other worldly wise and jaded, but not without empathy for the other characters who need the family and what that means for many people. Well written.", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "8"}}, "duration": "PT1H47M"}
