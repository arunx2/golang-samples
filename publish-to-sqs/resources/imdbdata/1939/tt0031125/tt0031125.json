This one, however, is formulaic and predictable and wears thin after a promising start. Hugh is getting married in the morning at Rockingham Castle. A Distinguished Professor appears on the scene to announce that a treasure is hidden somewhere in the Castle and a Bad Guy follows him - from here you can fill in the blanks.\n\nThe plot proceeds clumsily. There are elements of comic relief that are unfunny and annoying, provided by Reginald Denny as Algy and by Elizabeth Patterson as Aunt Blanche. Evidently, neither of them are equipped to handle comedy and the film suffers as a result. This series never lived up to the promise of the first talking Drummond, with Ronald Colman in the lead.\n\nI gave this one a rating of 5 and cannot recommend it despite good production values and a good cast."}, "duration": "PT56M"}
