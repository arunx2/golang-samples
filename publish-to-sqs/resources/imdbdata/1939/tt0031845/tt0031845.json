Remember? was absolutely great. I haven't laughed so hard in a long time. There are hilarious scenes and not just at the beginning of the picture like other reviewers have stated. When everyone around Taylor and Garson knows they are married except Taylor and Garson themselves, you can be sure riotous situations will ensue. \n\nThe cast is just perfect, although Lew Ayres never really appealed to me. Garson absolutely sparkles and Robert Taylor was never more handsome. Although the ending is rather surprising, you will not be sorry with this gem of a comedy.", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "9"}}, "duration": "PT1H23M"}
