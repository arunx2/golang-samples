Only a certain nostalgia for these kind of B-films that played the lower half of a double bill can have any appeal for modern viewers.\n\nThe actors aren't to blame. Bonita Granville as Nancy does an excellent job, as does Frankie Thomas as her All-American boyfriend Ted, and John Litel as her lawyer father. All of it, however, is weakened by a poor script and a weak storyline. Only the last twenty minutes or so maintains any real suspense.\n\nMost of it is pretty uninvolving but appeals more as a curiosity piece than anything else."}, "duration": "PT1H"}
