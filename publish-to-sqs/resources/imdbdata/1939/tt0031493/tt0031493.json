Dunne is warm and gracious as always and makes the most of the comedy here; MacMurray is excellent as the goofy fighter determined to be world champ. His final fight scenes are among the best and most realistic I've seen.\n\nSolid support from William Collier as Dunne's wise father and Charlie Ruggles as the wary fight manager. Billy Cook is the son, Marion Martin the the blonde, Virginia Brissac is the nurse, Oscar O'Shea is the judge.\n\nBut the stars here dominate this film. I've always been a big Irene Dunne fan but I must say I'm gaining a whole new vision of Fred MacMurray. Having grown up with \"My Three Sons,\" it's amazing to see the young MacMurray in a variety of solid 30s roles (many with Carole Lombard).\n\nExcellent film with something for everyone.", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "9"}}, "duration": "PT1H37M"}
