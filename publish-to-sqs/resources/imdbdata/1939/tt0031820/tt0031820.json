This time, the wolf has captured two of the three little pigs and takes them to his lair to be cooked for dinner, but the wolf wants to capture the remaining pig, The Practical Pig, before cook time. But, the Three Little Wolves have devious plans of their own. \n\nThere are a some of thrills and excitement in this one, but the wolf-capturing-pigs plot element ran thin this time around, and the Practical Pig's inventions seem to run a little overboard in this one, but, it yielded some hilarious, laugh-out-loud comedy when tried out on the Big Bad Wolf. \n\nAgain, it's nice to hear a reprise of the song, \"Who's Afraid of the Big Bad Wolf.\" \n\nOverall, a very nice final Three Little Pigs cartoon\n\nGrade B+", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "8"}}, "duration": "PT8M"}
