If you are not a fan of the classic horror genre or of Bela Lugosi, you may wish to pass on this one, but if you like corny old Bela films, you are in for a REAL treat.\n\nOne point of interest to me was that I can't help but think George Lucas had watched this serial in particular when he was preparing for Star Wars. The title of the series is \"The Phantom Creeps\" with the first Episode being titled \"The Menacing Power\" (Phantom Menace anyone?)  Additionally, the scrolling text of Star Wars seems to owe a lot to this serial right down to the usage of capitalization.  You'll have to wait for Chapter 2 to get your first glimpse of how it's used- Chapter 1 has no foreward.\n\nThis is the first serial I've seen, though, so it's possible that the scrolling text is common with most serials.", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "5"}}, "duration": "PT4H25M"}
