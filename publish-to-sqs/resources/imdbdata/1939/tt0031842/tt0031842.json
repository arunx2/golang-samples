THE REAL GLORY is a 'Boy's Own' style adventure romp through the jungles of the Phillipines following the Spanish-American War.  Cooper leads a small band of American soldiers and medical personnel as they train a police force to fight back against vicious Moro pirates who terrorize and prey upon the local villagers.  Cooper and co-star David Niven are the perfect Hollywood mix of heroism, gallantry and self-sacrifice. Director Hathaway fills THE REAL GLORY to the brim with rousing action sequences, desperate derring-do and the kind of buckle-swashing that heavily influenced modern classics like Spielberg's RAIDERS OF THE LOST ARK.  An absolutely top-notch film in every department.  This is escapist entertainment as only Golden Age Hollywood could produce.  If you like 'GUNGA DIN/RAIDERS' style filmmaking then this is a must-see.  A perfect Saturday night popcorn film."}, "duration": "PT1H36M"}
