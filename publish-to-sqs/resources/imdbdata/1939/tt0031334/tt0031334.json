Of the actors, only Ralph Richardson and C. Aubrey Smith are familiar. However, the ensemble play of the lesser known actors is certainly outstanding. I can still remember the determination of young Faversham desperately trying to regain his honor and his girl. After all these years I don't remember the finer details, but the film as a whole, as well as the book on which it is based are classics, and I'm certain Miklos Rozsa's lush strains added much to the overall effect. It's a film well worth seeing for those who enjoy derring-do and historical drama. I've never seen any of the other versions to see if I enjoyed them even half as much.", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "10"}}, "duration": "PT2H9M"}
