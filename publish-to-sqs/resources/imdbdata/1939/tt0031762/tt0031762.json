Ruman and Barthelmess were especially good in their supporting roles. Hayworth's role, one of her first, was not that much.\n\nIn all, a solid adventure-romance tale, and I'm shocked it gets so little attention on this website, with under 20 reviews as of my writing.", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "8"}}, "duration": "PT2H1M", "trailer": {"@type": "VideoObject", "name": "Official Trailer", "embedUrl": "/video/imdb/vi1062649369", "thumbnail": {"@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZGVkYTk1NmMtNGUyZi00ZjZkLTg5ZjgtMzRhMzA5MTIwOTkzXkEyXkFqcGdeQWdhbWF6b2E@._V1_.jpg"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZGVkYTk1NmMtNGUyZi00ZjZkLTg5ZjgtMzRhMzA5MTIwOTkzXkEyXkFqcGdeQWdhbWF6b2E@._V1_.jpg", "uploadDate": "2020-08-12T09:25:56Z"}}
