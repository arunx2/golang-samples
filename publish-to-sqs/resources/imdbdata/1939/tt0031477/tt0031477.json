The performances are very good and Lombard is just gorgeous. I think the best reason to see it is to see Kay Francis in a comeback performance.  She had been relegated to the undesirable list by the studios at this point in her career.  Her portrayal of Maida, Cary Grant's uncompromising wife, is great fun to watch.  The movie is a little cornball in parts but overall it works.  Lombard fans really won't be disappointed."}, "duration": "PT1H34M"}
