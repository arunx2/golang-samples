These three are closer to Charteris's literary creation (with Ian Ogilvy's TV series, Return of The Saint, in the late Seventies) than anything else. As Simon Templar, George Sanders is ruthless, cool, clinical and just on the right side of legality by a cat's whisker. Directed by John Paddy Carstairs (whom Leslie Charteris dedicated a book of short stories to 'for all the nice things he's (sic) done for the Saint)), the only director to work on both the films and the Roger Moore TV series, this hits the spot in a way most other entires don't. While Moore made the character his own, no one played Charteris's Saint better than Sanders on screen and Vincent Price on radio. Do youself a favour and watch this film to find out why.", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "7"}}, "duration": "PT1H12M"}
