How could WB have known that Garfield would be one of their great charismatic finds of the late 30s and thus not have written the script to make dust be his destiny?\n\nSo, unbelievably as in the first film, Ann is back with Felix (Jeffrey Lynn), planning to marry. Even without Garfield in the competition I'm just not buying it. But then Ann finds out that her consolation marriage with Mickey has left behind a consolation prize - she is pregnant. The pregnancy, along with Mickey's ghost - it is not hard to believe that a woman preferring Jeffrey Lynn romantically would raise the dead, and Ann's melancholy over her dead husband's tragic life, make it difficult for her to move on.\n\nThe one big annoyance here is Aunt Etta (May Robson) is in overdrive here, constantly babbling on about Ann and Mickey's baby. Breathe, Aunt Etta, Breathe! I guess I should just be in wonder that Robson, 81 at the time, added such energy to the part. Mildly recommended, in particular if you want to see how the melodrama in the first film in the series plays out in the second.", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "6"}}, "duration": "PT1H50M"}
