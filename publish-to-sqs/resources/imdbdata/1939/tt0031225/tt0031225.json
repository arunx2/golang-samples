Brian Donlevy is the bad guy who runs the town and Marlene Dietrich runs the saloon. Destry is a very, very low key guy, and the whole fun of the film is how he surprises the town\u00b4s people by turning up to be the opposite of what they think he is. Dietrich has a few great musical numbers and she brings a lot to the film. But the most fun is really Stewart, whenever he wants to make a statement he gives as an example several fictitious friends, after a while they all know it is a lie, but still keep listening. You can see this film a hundred times and still enjoy it.", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "10"}}, "duration": "PT1H35M", "trailer": {"@type": "VideoObject", "name": "Official Trailer", "embedUrl": "/video/imdb/vi3884171545", "thumbnail": {"@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNGFhOTRhYzMtNWEwOC00NWMzLWJlNzAtYTAxNTU5ODNkYmU2XkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNGFhOTRhYzMtNWEwOC00NWMzLWJlNzAtYTAxNTU5ODNkYmU2XkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg", "description": "Deputy sheriff Destry tames the town of Bottle Neck, including saloon singer Frenchy.", "uploadDate": "2020-10-06T11:43:23Z"}}
