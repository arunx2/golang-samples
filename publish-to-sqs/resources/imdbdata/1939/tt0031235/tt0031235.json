This one has a  \"clean up the town\" storyline, plenty of action, but perhaps too much comedy, given the course of the plot.  For the most part it's a typical product of Warner Brothers' golden era, with Flynn's usual supporting cast, including Olivia de Havilland, Alan Hale, and Guinn Williams.\n\nThe film does have one very interesting sequence, especially in light of future movie history.  In a saloon scene about halfway through, a group of cowboys with northern roots, or at least Union sympathies, start singing \"Marching Through Georgia.\"  Not to be outdone, another group, led by Williams, begins to sing  \"Dixie.\"  Before long, punches are thrown and a mammoth brawl breaks out. \n\nSound familiar?  Except for the fight, the scene resembles the song duel in \"Casablanca\", made at Warners three years later.  Although the screen writers aren't the same, I have to think this was the inspiration for the battle between \"Wacht am Rhein\" and \"Les Marseilles.\""}, "duration": "PT1H44M", "trailer": {"@type": "VideoObject", "name": "Trailer", "embedUrl": "/video/imdb/vi3536240921", "thumbnail": {"@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZTgwOGM3NTUtYjQzOS00NmE1LWE3NzktY2ZjMDU5NTVmMTFiXkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZTgwOGM3NTUtYjQzOS00NmE1LWE3NzktY2ZjMDU5NTVmMTFiXkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg", "description": "A Texas cattle agent witnesses first hand, the brutal lawlessness of Dodge City and takes the job of sheriff to clean the town up.", "uploadDate": "2020-11-17T10:45:30Z"}}
