They travel to his lands in the Mohawk Valley, Deerfield, where they work hard to improve their lives, but their house and crop are burned out by Indians fomented by the British. The couple loses everything including their baby and they have to restart their lives working for the widow Mrs. McKlennar (Edna May Oliver). But it is times of the American War of Independence, and the settlers have to fight against the Indians and the British soldiers to survive. \n\n\"Drums along the Mohawk\" is a romance in times of the American War of Independence. John Ford uses the historic moment as background of the tough life of the American colonists in the Mohawk Valley, through the dramatic lives of Gil and Lana. This is not my favorite film of John Ford, but the story is engaging and it is a good movie. The thirty-six year old Claudette Colbert is miscast and too old for the role of Lana. My vote is seven.\n\nTitle (Brazil): \"Ao Rufar dos Tambores\" (\"At the Drum Roll\")", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "7"}}, "duration": "PT1H44M", "trailer": {"@type": "VideoObject", "name": "Drums Along The Mohawk", "embedUrl": "/video/imdb/vi3478979097", "thumbnail": {"@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BOTQ1MDAwZjUtMTY0Ny00MjkwLWE4ZWItMjAwYmJhMjdhNjNiXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BOTQ1MDAwZjUtMTY0Ny00MjkwLWE4ZWItMjAwYmJhMjdhNjNiXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg", "description": "Page turning trailer for this black and white western", "uploadDate": "2009-10-09T12:07:54Z"}}
