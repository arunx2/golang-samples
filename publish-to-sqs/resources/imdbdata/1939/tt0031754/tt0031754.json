Watching this movie was a \"right smart piece of time\"....as Gramp declared at the end of the movie.\n\nThis is my first outing with this movie...I can almost kick myself for not recording it.  What a wonderful outing it was!\n\nLionel Barrymore continually amazes me.  He could sure play some interesting parts - and his voice is so perfect for these grandfatherly roles.  My favorite of his is \"You Can't Take It With You\"....which is a great piece of theater, too.\n\nI thought the child actor, Bobs Watson, was perfect in this role. Some here have said he was on the annoying side.  But which 10 year-old kid isn't?? He played it to a \"T\" and his crying episodes were too real for me.\n\nI never knew my grandfathers too well.  They both died before I got to know them.  One died when I was 4 years old and the other one died back in Cuba and I never got to see him off.  \n\nSure, I had my grandmothers...and I loved them both so dearly.  OH....to have had a grandfather like PUD does in this movie!  I feel such a sense of loss when I think of what wonderful times I might have had with my grandfathers.\n\nAnd this movie, sure made this topic hit close to home.  I guess I will have to wait until Mr. Brink calls on me to meet my grampses...\n\nYessir....A Right Smart Piece of Time I spent watching this endearing movie. \n\n***I recommend this movie to anyone who has the sense to know they have a heart __ that beats and loves and cries...but most of all, that lives...and lives on...***", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "10"}}, "duration": "PT1H39M"}
