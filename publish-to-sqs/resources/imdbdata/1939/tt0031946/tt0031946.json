OK.\n\nThe plot is good. The haunting Virginia Bruce is as good as she always was. Those pale, worried looking eyes were unique! Too bad she didn't have a true A-list career. Lee Bowman is good too, in a small but pivotal role.\n\nThe gangsters are not e believable. They are sort of goofy and sometimes comical. OK, this is not a film noir. But murder and corruption aren't cute. They are made to seem so here. It's a chic bonbon made to look like a thriller.
