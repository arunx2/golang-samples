While his friends at the newspaper try to find out who framed him, Frank gets hardened by prison life and his optimism turns into bitterness. He meets fellow-inmate Stacey (George Raft) and they decide to help each other.\n\nRather than be the good guy (\"G Men\") or the bad guy (\"Public Enemy\"), here we have Cagney as an innocent newspaper reporter framed and then sent to prison, where he becomes a little bit hardened. Maybe not quite a bad guy, but not really the good guy, either. It is a nice transformation, and an interesting commentary on prison life.\n\nI am not very familiar with George Raft (I actually know him more from reading Mafia history than from film), but if he is like he is here in other films, I need to see more George Raft.", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "7"}}, "duration": "PT1H32M", "trailer": {"@type": "VideoObject", "name": "Each Dawn I Die", "embedUrl": "/video/imdb/vi3255568153", "thumbnail": {"@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYTk1ODc0Y2EtODBjNi00ZDQ4LThjNzctNWM1MjQ3MDA3ZmRjXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYTk1ODc0Y2EtODBjNi00ZDQ4LThjNzctNWM1MjQ3MDA3ZmRjXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg", "description": "Trailer for this strange story of two men from opposite worlds", "uploadDate": "2010-05-18T15:10:56Z"}}
