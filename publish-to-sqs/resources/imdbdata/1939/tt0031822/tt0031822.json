Perhaps because BUGS BUNNY isn't the Bugs we all came to know later on. He's sketched in with little character and never once says his famous: \"What's up, doc?\" Chuck Jones was clearly experimenting with the little rabbit and does have him playing the sort of pranks he would become famous for once he became a cartoon celebrity.\n\nAnimation is okay, the pace is very fast with numerous sight gags due to the clever bunny, and it must have appealed to children at the time.\n\nSumming up: Not one of the better Bugs Bunny cartoons.", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "5"}}, "duration": "PT7M"}
